        <h3>A Preventable Future</h3>
        <p>Global warming is the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past few centuries. Since the mid-20th century, Climate scientists have gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition). These data have indicated that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that the influence of human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution has been deeply woven into the very fabric of climate change. It is now time to take responsibility.</p>
